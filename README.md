# My playground

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app I use to test and explore new UI / UX and other components.

## Getting started

After cloning the repo, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
